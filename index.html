    <h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
      <p> 
        The purpose of creating this site is to practice HTML and CSS skills while also creating a personal storage site for my projects. on the "About" page, you will find a description of my computer science experiences and interests, and on the "Computer Science Projects" page you will find a portfolio of my 2017 Summer Semester projects for my Computer Science Class.

      This picture represents my artistic side and love of the outdoors, but on a more technical level it demonstrates my ability to modify and form something. One forms a program through many small steps, just as one forms a painting through many small strokes.
