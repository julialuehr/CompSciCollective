        The purpose of creating this site is to practice HTML and CSS skills while also creating a personal storage site for my projects. on the "About" page, you will find a description of my computer science experiences and interests, and on the "Computer Science Projects" page you will find a portfolio of my 2017 Summer Semester projects for my Computer Science Class.
