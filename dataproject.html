    <h1>Data Project</h1>
      
    <h3>Problem: How to find local parks containing the desired equipment or activity areas for each user.</h3>
    <h3>Target Audience: Outdoor minded adults and teens, ages 12+, residents of Sandy Hook Circle.</h3>
    <h3>How a Data Recommendation Can Help: Using data, a recommendation could match the users desired park needs to various local Chanhassen parks.</h3>
    
   <p>The Data will be collected through an email survey, sent out the the Target Audience. The prompt they are answering will be,"At the ideal park for you, are the following amenities necessary?," follwed by seven Y/N questions.
     The questions will ask about greenspace, playgrounds, a beach, a tennis court, a running trail, a pavillion, and a basketball hoop.
     The Yes/No data is then compiled in a spreadsheet and in a much more usable data form.
