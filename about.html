      I am a very inexperienced computer science student, but I'm looking forward to advancing myself in this field. I worked with
      Scratch in elementary school and made small video games, but this is the extent of my computer science experience. I enrolled 
      in this class because I love the STEM fields(in which technology and coding are increasingly prevalent), and was intrigued
      to further myself in this area.
